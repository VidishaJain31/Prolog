% u read it like water is wet -  this is a fact 
% here, wet is the termenology / functor
% water is the characteristic  
wet(water).
wet(milk).
wet(orange_juice).
% run the file
% then type wet(X). then press tab
% this will give all facts in the database related to what is asked (wet(X)) 
% this is called backtracking
% it checks ur rules and facts and finds whether in can satisfy the question asked in the database
% if u press enter answer is accepted ; tab ans is rejected


% backtracking is somehow a recursion that happens on prolog backend to satify the question 
% first it goes to your database and tries to find an answer if it matches any statement that can be of true, it will show it to u. if that is someting u didnt want then it goes back to the database find maybe this is true it sends that.
