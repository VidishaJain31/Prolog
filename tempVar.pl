% database manipulation
% how to add rules at runtime
% u can manipulate the db at runtime
% u can add a fact or remove at runtime

% asserta adds rules at starting of the database
% assertz adds rules at the end of the database
% retract removes the rules from the database
% this feature can create like a global variable   
% explaination : u can have a variable when u start (the recursion) put that variable there start calculating that variable , update the variable every recursion and show it to the user and remove it from the database
% use case of asserta and retract is to assert a temporary variable, update it
% how to update is remove it and add it again




% it is not a recursive process
